# IT Helpdesk Agent â€“ AI Powered Support  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project is a proof-of-concept for an **AI-powered IT Helpdesk Agent**.  
The agent leverages the **Strands framework** to orchestrate tools and workflows, and integrates with **Anthropicâ€™s Claude models** (via **Amazon Bedrock**) to process requests, understand context, and automate IT support tasks.  

The goal is to **reduce manual workload** for IT teams by automating repetitive queries and enabling intelligent assistance for employees.
